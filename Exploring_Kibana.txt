- In last 7 days, 231 unique visitors in India
- In last 24 hours, 66 unique visitors in China using Mac OSX.
- 503: 2.222%	404: 3.333%
- In last 7 days, China produced the majority (20%) of the traffic on the website.
- 10am had highest amount of activity.

- Avg bypes: 10,735.667
- Unique visitors: 3

-What is potentially strange about this activity is that the number of unique visitors was very low compared to other timestamps.

6. According to the _source files from the timestamps , there doesn't appear to be any nefarious activity going on. 
The only activities listed on the timestamps at or around the timestamp where the activity was first detected were made by 
the virtual machines and filebeat updates. However, as seen in the picture (Kibana_Discover), the activity from the timestamp
listed above does not appear in the list of the _source files. The fact that the avg bytes are higher compared to other activities
and the country of origin and destination being India and China respectively is nonetheless suspicious. The high byte number could 
be an indication that a user is exfiltrating data.
